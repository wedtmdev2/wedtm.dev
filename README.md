> He ended up bringing in a new lead developer: Jacob Jervey, who had previously co-founded a Minecraft server hosting company called Brohosting.
>
> Smith was then running the whole operation himself, handling development, operations, and customer support. Money was running out. Smith says funded the whole operation out of his savings and never took any outside investment. "I had the money to either support my family the way I want to, or take care of the customers the way I wanted to," he says. "Not both."

> He's not sure what he's going to do next, but he says he learned when to quit. "There's no point in going down with a dying ship," he says. "Especially if I'm the one causing it to die."

> I want to apologize to everyone who was affected by this. MyRedis was my first SaaS, and it was a learning experience in many ways (and continues to be, apparently). [July 9, 2013](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6014777)
